This file is how to create a new version of the software:

As of version 4.6.9 the MIRI DHAS software is under version control at STScI.


Steps to update code at STScI:
1. svn status
    a. Get a list of files that have been modified, added, or unknown status ?
        svn add
        svn delete
        svn copy
        svn move
        svn diff
      
    b. Figure out what to do with ?
  	The FITS files and *.sav files will have ? - leave these

2. svn commit -m 'MIRI DHAS version x.y.z'

Steps to export version without the .svn directories


   a From /home/morrison/DHAS

   b. svn export /home/morrison/DHAS /home/morrison/new version
        (you do not have the first create the new version directory - it will do it)
     
   d. copy files not in svn:
      copy *.fits all found in /MPipeline/Cal/Lab
      copy *.sav found in MPipeline/ProScript
