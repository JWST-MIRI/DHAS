This file contain the software changes to the MIRI DHAS. This file was started with
version 4.6.9 (June 29, 2010). Before that a record of the changes can be found on
the MIRI DHAS web page: tiamat.as.arizona.edu/dhas/.  This web site will continue to
have a record of the softeare changes given in this document.

Changes for Version 4.7.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MIRI_SLOPER changes
1. Added an plane to LVL2 files, standard deviation of the FIT in DN. 
2. Fixed various problems with subarray data:
	a. Not applying bad pixel file correctly
	b. Not reading in Non-linearity correction correctly

QL Changes
1. Made a number of changes to support JPL testing. These were not bug fixes just user interface
	preferences.
2. Removed all the Retall and Stop lines, these do not work in the Virtual Machine Mode -
they cause the program to completely exit

3. If the left hand reference pixels in sub array mode exist, then the ql will display them.


Changes for Version 4.6.11:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CV changes: corrected a bug when plotting the cube pixel on the detector image. The corners
were incorrect  by 1/2 a pixel.


Changes for Version 4.6.10:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most of the changes are to support cv feature to click on a cube pixel and report the
detector pixel the data came from by using the d2c files. A display of the science slope
image data is display with the location of the cube pixel. 
1. modified mrs_write_header.cpp to add writing the SCIDIR. This was need to find which
data set was used to create the cube so it could be displayed with the cube pixel outline
over plotted. 
2. Added to directory CV: cv_display_slope_image.pro, read_image_file.pro, find_image_file.pro
   These are needed to read and display the science image 


Changes for Version 4.6.9:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The major reason for this version is to update the softwave in the SVN system at
STScI. Jane Morrison will then maintain the software starting with this version using
the STScI svn system. 

Changes to cv
1. Updated read_cube_header.pro to read in the channel & subchannel of the cube
2. Added the software: skycube2detector.pro. This program is still in development but
it will convert the sky alpha, beta, lamba values to x, y pixel values on the detector. 

Changes to miri_cube: 
1. in mrs_write_header.cpp added writing the channel and subchannel of the cube to the header.
