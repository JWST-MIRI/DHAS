If the "Analyze" button is pushed from the ql main window a new window pops up
that allows the user to 

	A. View in a single a window a science image frame, its associated reference 
image and the resulting slope image (if the miri_sloper program was run). In order 
to fit all these images on 1 window the images are binned. The default binning is
a 4 X 4 binning. This binning is set in the preferences file. 

From this window the user can query certain pixel values, change the stretch of
the display, view statistical information for each image, view a zoomed image
of either the science data, reference data or slope data, plot histograms, row
or column slices of the images.
	 
	B. Analyze by Amplifier: 
		1. Plot a selected frame and split the image into data from each
of the 5 amplifiers. From this window the user can display pixel values (in
the 258 X 1024 amplifier reference frame)  zoom, display basic statistics,
plot a histogram, column or row slice plots for each of the amplifier images. 
	 
		2. Plot the data from the 5 amplifiers on the same plot in readout
order. This window allows the user to select which amplifiers to plot and to change
the range of the plots. 



Definition of relevant code:

MAIN WIDGET: 
	mql_display_images.pro : display the science image, zoom image, 
reference image, and slope image

PIXEl INFORMATION:
	The user can click on the image and seperate window will pop up to
display the data values associated with this pixel for all the frames in the
integration, as well as, the reference data  values. The use can then query different
pixel values either by selecting difference pixel from this "Pixel Information"
window or by clicking on a new pixel any of the images. 
	If the user wishes to turn off the window popping up each time a pixel is
clicked on then the button on the upper left hand side of the window :
"Display Pixel Values" can turn this function off.  


STATISTICAL INFORMATION:
	By clicking on the "Statistics" button above each image a new window will
pop up giving basic statistcal information on the image. 

PLOT OPTIONS:
	By clicking on the "Plot Options"  button the user can display a histogram
of each image or a column or row slice of the data at the selected pixel location.

CHANGE OF SCALE:
	The user can change the stretch of the display of the images by changing
the minimum and maximum display range in the windows next to "Default Scale" . To
return to the "Default Scale" click on the  "User Set Scale" button. Which used
to be called "Default Scale" button.

INSPECT IMAGES:
	The user can display the image a full image (no binning) mode by clicking 
on the "Inspect Image" button.


CHANGE IMAGE DISPLAYED:
	The frame number and integration number can be change by clikcing on 
the "Change Image Displayed" button.

BINNING OF IMAGE:
	The images are by default displayed with a 4 x 4 binning. Besides clicking
on the "Inspect Image" button the user can display the images with out binning,
but with a scroll window by clicking on the "Binned Image" button on the left
side of the screen. 

ANALYZE BY AMPLIFIER:
	The use to display the images by grouping the data into which amplifier it
is associated with by clicking on the "Analyze Amplifer" button on the top
of the menu bar. Two options are given: "Display Raw Image by Amplifier" and
"Plot amplifier data in read out order". But clicking on either of these windows
a seperate window will pop up.  
	a. "Display Raw Image by Amplifier" displays the 5 amplifier images. A
number of options exist to analyze these images:
		1. "Get Statistics" gives the basic statistics of each amplifier image.
		2. "Change Image Displayed" allows the user to select a different 
		frame or integration to display.
		3. "Zoom" allows the user to zoom the, with the center of the zoom 
		image to be the location of the cursor.
		4. "Plot Options" : allows the user to plot a histograom of the image
		values, or a column or row slice through the current cursor location
		5. "Display Pixel Values" by default by clicking on any image the 
		pixel values (in the amplifier reference frame 258 X 1024) will be 
	 	displayed. To turn this function off click on this button.

	b. "Plot amplifier data in read out order" : will plot on the same graph the
data for each amplifier in a different color. There are options to plot only select
amplifiers or to change the range of the graph.
