The Quick Look tool set (ql) is an interactive program for image visualization,
manipulation, and analysis. It is written in the Interactive Data Language (IDL)
developed by Research Systems, Inc. This program was started in 2004 as an
analysis tool for testing  data produced by the MIRI JWST instrument. 

This program has a limited number of commandline options. These command line option
are mainly for selecting the file to display as well as the location of this file.
This program has been developed mainly as an interactive tool to assist in
testing and characterizing the MIRI electronics and detector. 

If science images are to be analysed then then,  the user should first run
the "miri_sloper" cpp program. This program converts the measured charge ramps 
into slope values for each frame. If this program is not run prior to the
Ql then no slope image will be represent, but the user can still view the
science frames and telemetry data. 

The primary features of the QL tool set:

1. View Telemetry:
 	Plot up to 4 selected telemetry values on the same plot for the entire 
exposure. From this telemetry window the user can select the ranges of the values
to plot and print the plots to a postscript file. 

2. Analyze:
	A. An image display window that allow the user to view in a single a window
a science image frame, its associated reference image and the resulting
slope image (if the miri_sloper program was run).  In order to fit all these images
on 1 window the images are binned. The default binning is a 4 X 4 binning. This
binning is set in the preferences file. 


From this window the user can query certain pixel values, change the stretch of
the display, view statistical information for each image, view a zoomed image
of either the science data, reference data or slope data, plot histograms, row
or column slices of the images.
	 
	B. Analyze by Amplifier: 
		1. Plot a selected frame and split the image into data from each
of the 5 amplifiers. From this window the user can display pixel values (in
the 258 X 1024 amplifier reference frame)  zoom, display basic statistics,
plot a histogram, column or row slice plots for each of the amplifier images. 
	 
		2. Plot the data from the 5 amplifiers on the same plot in readout
order. This window allows the user to select which amplifiers to plot and to change
the range of the plots. 

3. Compare Data:
	Compare two science frames or two slope images. The comparison plot is by 
default a difference images, but a ratio and addition image are also options. 
Below the three images (the 2 frames of slope images and the comparison image)
a histogram of the data is plotted. The used can change the strectch of the images,
as well as, the range of the histogram plots. 

4. Run Pipeline:
	A. Run the miri_sloper program on a user selected file.
	B. Edit the default values used in the miri_sloper program

5. Edit:
	A. Edit the preferences file that used to set the defaults for the
miri_sloper program and the quicklook tool.
	B. Change the color of the images from black and white to color.
